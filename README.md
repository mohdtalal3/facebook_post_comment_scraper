# Facebook Scraper 🕷️

A powerful Python-based Facebook scraping tool with a PyQt6 GUI interface for extracting posts, comments, and images from Facebook pages, groups, and individual posts without using the official Facebook API.

## 🎯 Key Highlights

- **Pure Requests-Based**: No browser automation or Selenium required - uses direct HTTP requests to Facebook's GraphQL API
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Minimal dependencies, efficient memory usage, and faster execution
- **No Browser Intervention**: Operates entirely through HTTP requests without spawning browser instances
- **Headless Operation**: Perfect for servers and automated workflows

## ✨ Features

- **Multiple Scraping Modes**:
  - 📄 Single post scraping (text, images, comments, and replies)
  - 👤 Page/Profile posts scraping
  - 👥 Facebook Group posts scraping
  - 🖼️ High-quality image extraction
  
- **Rich Data Extraction**:
  - Post content (text, reactions, shares)
  - Comments and nested replies
  - User information (names, IDs, profile links)
  - Media content (images with multiple resolution support)
  - Timestamps and engagement metrics

- **User-Friendly GUI**:
  - PyQt6-based desktop interface
  - Real-time logging and progress tracking
  - Tabbed interface for different scraping types
  - Easy configuration and export

- **Robust Architecture**:
  - Pure `requests` library implementation (no browser/Selenium)
  - Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - Proxy support for privacy and rate limiting
  - Pagination handling for large data sets
  - JSON export for easy data processing
  - Direct GraphQL API communication

## 🆕 Latest Enhancements (v2.0)

- **🎯 Enhanced Comment Detection**:
  - 6 extraction paths for comment counts
  - Handles deeply nested comment structures
  - Ensures posts with 49+ comments are correctly detected
  - Never skips posts due to missing comment count data

- **🔍 Advanced Story Node Discovery**:
  - Multi-location Story node detection (Group edges, timeline edges, direct nodes)
  - Handles complex JSON structures from Facebook's varying response formats
  - Discovers posts that were previously hidden in nested structures

- **📸 Complete Album Scraping**:
  - Automatically fetches ALL images from posts (up to 50 per post)
  - Uses media ID iteration to navigate through large albums
  - No longer limited to first 5 images
  - Perfect for posts with 10-20+ images

- **♻️ Smart Deduplication**:
  - Detects already-scraped posts by checking saved JSON files
  - Skips duplicate posts when resuming interrupted sessions
  - Saves bandwidth and processing time
  - Automatic folder structure validation

- **🔄 Intelligent Retry Logic**:
  - 3-attempt retry for transient Facebook API errors
  - 2-second delays between retry attempts
  - Handles empty response arrays gracefully
  - Prevents infinite loops on persistent failures

- **🎬 Content Filtering**:
  - Automatic reel and video post detection and skipping
  - Configurable minimum comment threshold
  - Focus on high-engagement photo posts only

- **🛡️ Robust Error Handling**:
  - Safe pagination with proper break conditions
  - No infinite loops on empty responses
  - Comprehensive error logging
  - Graceful degradation on failures

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Valid Facebook session tokens (extracted from browser - one-time setup)
- No browser automation tools required (Selenium, Playwright, etc.)
- Works with pure HTTP requests

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohdtalal3/facebook_post_comment_scraper
cd facebook_post_comment_scraper
```

2. Install required dependencies (minimal and lightweight):
```bash
pip install requests PyQt6 python-dotenv
```

Note: Only `requests` is needed for scraping - no browser automation libraries required!

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
# Optional: Add your proxy if needed
PROXY=http://your-proxy:port

# Optional: Add any other configuration
```

### Required Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file:
```txt
requests>=2.28.0
PyQt6>=6.4.0
python-dotenv>=0.20.0
```

Install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🐳 Running via Docker (Recommended / Easiest Setup)

If you prefer to run the application inside a Docker container (which packages Python, PyQt6, Google Chrome, and all required system libraries for you), you can run it using Docker Compose.

This setup uses **noVNC** to stream the PyQt6 graphical interface directly to your web browser. This is extremely helpful for completing the **automated Facebook login & 2FA steps** inside the container.

### 1. Start the Container (GUI Mode - Default)

Run the following command in the project root directory:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 2. Access the GUI

Open your web browser on your host machine and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/vnc.html
```
Click the **Connect** button (no password required) to access the PyQt6 desktop interface.

### 3. Run in CLI Mode (Alternative)

If you wish to use the interactive command-line interface menu inside the container:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm -e RUN_MODE=CLI scraper
```

### 4. Persistence of Data & Login Sessions
- **Scraped Data**: Output JSON files and downloaded images are saved inside local folders (`simple_post/`, `page_post/`, `group_post/`) on your host machine.
- **Login Session**: Your Chrome profile is persisted inside the local `chromedata1/` folder. This stores your Facebook cookies and 2FA authentication state so you don't need to re-login every time you run the container.

## 📖 Usage

### GUI Mode (Recommended)

Launch the graphical interface:
```bash
python facebook_ui.py
```

The GUI provides three main tabs:
1. **Simple Post**: Scrape a single post with all its comments and images
2. **Page Posts**: Extract multiple posts from a Facebook page or profile
3. **Group Posts**: Scrape posts from Facebook groups

### CLI Mode

For advanced users, you can use the command-line interface:

```python
from main import extract_post_id_from_url, fetch_comments_for_post, save_post_data

# Extract post ID
post_id = extract_post_id_from_url("https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=123...")

# Fetch comments
comments = fetch_comments_for_post(post_id, max_comments=100)

# Save data
save_post_data(post_id, comments, "output_dir")
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Proxy Configuration

Add your proxy to the `.env` file:
```env
PROXY=http://username:password@proxy-server:port
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Legal & Ethical Considerations

- **Terms of Service**: This tool may violate Facebook's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate delays between requests to avoid detection.
- **Privacy**: Respect user privacy and data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
- **Personal Use**: This tool is intended for educational and research purposes only.

### Technical Limitations

- **Doc IDs**: Facebook's GraphQL document IDs change frequently. You'll need to update them periodically.
- **Authentication**: Requires valid Facebook session tokens that expire.
- **Rate Limits**: Excessive requests may result in temporary blocks or account restrictions.
- **Private Content**: Cannot access content that requires authentication beyond what's provided.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Failed after 5 attempts" error**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify proxy settings
- Update DOC_ID values
- Ensure session tokens are valid

**2. No data returned**
- Verify the URL/ID is correct
- Check if content is publicly accessible
- Update authentication headers

**3. GUI not launching**
- Ensure PyQt6 is properly installed: `pip install --upgrade PyQt6`
- Check Python version compatibility

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by modifying the scripts:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
